# Power BI Banking Dashboard

## Introduction

This Power BI project analyzes banking data from two datasets: customer account details and transaction records. The goal is to convert raw financial data into meaningful insights that help banks understand customer behavior, monitor transaction trends, and evaluate branch performance. The dashboard supports data-driven decision-making in banking operations.

## Problem Statement

Banks collect large amounts of data, but without proper analysis, it's hard to make smart decisions. This project solves that problem by creating a dashboard that shows key patternsâ€”like how customers use their accounts, when and where most transactions happen, and how branches are performing. These insights help improve customer service, manage risks, and plan better strategies.
